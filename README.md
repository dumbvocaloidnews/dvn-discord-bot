‚ú® „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ!

This repository serves as the main landing point of the discord bot for [Dumb] Vocaloid News! \
[Again, the name is to not be taken offensively. Please.] 

This repository is open source for multiple reasons, mainly for transparency but please do feel free to contribute as you may seem fit! \
There may be some things I may not catch that don't come up in quality control but may come up sometime sooner or later so if you notice anything, fork and make a PR as soon as possible so it can be squashed before it multiplies!

There will soon be a guide on how to use this bot but as again, one person team, I must focus on one thing at a time. Thanks for your understanding.

ü•ã Respectfully, \
Andromeda
