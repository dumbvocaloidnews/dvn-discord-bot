I didn't forget about this project, I promise! \
This directory serves as a way of showing how the internal code works and how I plan to implement things as well as how it comes out. \
Could use a bit of TLC here and there but other than that, it works pretty nicely to how I see it. 

I usually try to leave comments on how my code works so for those who don't understand but would love to understand can catch a glimpse of how everything works. It's one of those moments where you start to piece everything together one by one until you finally understand with the words of "ohHHHHHHH SO THAT'S HOW THAT'S DONE?! THAT'S SO COOL!"

Anywho, `test.ts` is the file that contains the code that gives the output, `test.md`.
